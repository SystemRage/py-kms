You want to improve this project? Awesome! But before you wirte or modify the existing source code, please note the following guideline:

- Always make sure to add your changes to the wiki.
- 8-space indentation without tabs.
- Docstrings as this:
```python
    """ This is single line docstring. """
    """ This is a
    """ multiline comment.
```
- Wrap lines only if really long (it does not matter 79 chars, otherwise see [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/))
- For the rest a bit as it comes :)
