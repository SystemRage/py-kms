## Documentation
The wiki has been completly reworked and is now available on [readthedocs.com](https://py-kms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It should you provide all necessary information how to setup and to use _py-kms_ , all without clumping this readme. The documentation also houses more details about activation with _py-kms_ and how to get GVLK keys.
       
## Quick start
- To start the server, execute `python3 pykms_Server.py [IPADDRESS] [PORT]`, the default _IPADDRESS_ is `0.0.0.0` ( all interfaces ) and the default _PORT_ is `1688`. Note that both the address and port are optional. It's allowed to use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If you have a IPv6-capable dual-stack OS, a dual-stack socket is created when using a IPv6 address.
- To start the server automatically using Docker, execute `docker run -d --name py-kms --restart always -p 1688:1688 pykmsorg/py-kms`.
- To show the help pages type: `python3 pykms_Server.py -h` and `python3 pykms_Client.py -h`.
- For launching _py-kms_ GUI make the file `pykms_Server.py` executable with `chmod +x /path/to/folder/py-kms/pykms_Server.py`, then simply run `pykms_Server.py` by double-clicking.
