## History
_py-kms_ is a port of node-kms created by [cyrozap](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/members/183074-markedsword), which is a port of either the C#, C++, or .NET implementations of KMS Emulator. The original version was written by [CODYQX4](http://forums.mydigitallife.info/members/89933-CODYQX4) and is derived from the reverse-engineered code of Microsoft's official KMS.
This version of _py-kms_ is for itself a fork of the original implementation by [SystemRage](https://github.com/SystemRage/py-kms), which was abandoned early 2021.

## Documentation
The wiki has been completly reworked and is now available on [readthedocs.com](https://py-kms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). It should you provide all necessary information how to setup and to use _py-kms_ , all without clumping this readme. The documentation also houses more details about activation with _py-kms_ and how to get GVLK keys.
       
## Quick start
- To start the server, execute `python3 pykms_Server.py [IPADDRESS] [PORT]`, the default _IPADDRESS_ is `::` ( all interfaces ) and the default _PORT_ is `1688`. Note that both the address and port are optional. It's allowed to use IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If you have a IPv6-capable dual-stack OS, a dual-stack socket is created when using a IPv6 address. **In case your OS does not support IPv6, make sure to explicitly specify the legacy IPv4 of `0.0.0.0`!**
- To start the server automatically using Docker, execute `docker run -d --name py-kms --restart always -p 1688:1688 ghcr.io/py-kms-organization/py-kms`.
- To show the help pages type: `python3 pykms_Server.py -h` and `python3 pykms_Client.py -h`.
