### py-kms_2018-11-15
 - Implemented some good modifications inspired by [this](https://github.com/ThunderEX/py-kms) other fork.
 	- Clean up code ( deleted no longer useful files randomHWID.py, randomEPID.py, timezones.py;
			erased useless functions and import modules )
	- Reading parameters directly from a slightly modified KmsDataBase.xml ( created with LicenseManager 5.0 by Hotbird64 HGM ) with kmsDB2Dict.py
